# Visualizing sorting algorithms

## This is a program made with pygame and pygame_gui that can be used to visualize sorting algorithms.

**The program includes visualization of:**
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort

It also includes **custom and random array creation** to test the sortings, and a *not yet beautiful* timer of how fast the sort proceeded.

I made this project to learn pygame and also some python. If you want to make any contribution to the project, please do so. I would be glad to see what are your suggestions :)
